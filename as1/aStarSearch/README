README

To run this program launch the driver and follow the displayed instructions. 
The user will first be asked to choose a heuristic function to solve the problems. Valid input is either 1 or 2.
After this the user can choose to generate 120 semi-random problems using a shuffle algorithim, or to generate one true random problem. This however may take very long to solve.

For every problem being solved there will be this output:

|x|x|x|		Current puzzle problem being solved
|x|x|x|
|x|x|x|		After a solution is found the information
			below will be displayed

Depth: ---				<-- depth of problem solution
Nodes Frontier: ----	<-- number of nodes in the frontier*
Nodes Explored: ----	<-- number of nodes in the explored*
